# adventofcode2024

Welcome to my attempts, completed in 2024, of the programming problems for Advent of Code 2021, an annual coding challenge that takes place every December. This repository contains my solutions for the puzzles, implemented in C and Python.

## Overview

Advent of Code is a series of 25 coding challenges, released daily from December 1st to December 25th. Each puzzle tests problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking, making it a fun and rewarding way to improve programming expertise during the holiday season.

I will be completing the first 15 days each, as I have commitments as well as ongoing Advent of Code 2024 to complete. I am using this as practice for coding in various languages.

## Language Choices

C: For its speed, memory efficiency, and low-level control, offering a challenge for algorithm optimization.

Python: For its simplicity and readability, making it easier to explore solutions and implement complex algorithms quickly.

## To Do

C++: Combines the performance of C with modern features like STL (Standard Template Library), making it ideal for implementing efficient data structures and algorithms.

Java: With its robust object-oriented features and strong typing, Java provides a balance of performance and maintainability, suitable for solving complex problems systematically.

JavaScript: A versatile and dynamic language, ideal for quick prototyping and experimenting with solutions, especially leveraging its widespread ecosystem.
